To compile this exmaple right way, pugixml.cpp, pugixml.hpp and pugiconfig.hpp should exist.

add only main.cpp and pugixml.cpp to executable in CMakeLists.txt


exmaple of CMakeLists:


cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.24)
project(untitled5)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

add_executable(untitled5 main.cpp pugixml.cpp)


I hope this helps if you are facing a problem.
